        "Antananarivo – gateway to the heart of Madagascar \n\n Antananarivo, the capital of Madagascar, is often referred to as the “City of a Thousand,” a name rooted in its royal origins under King Andrianjaka in 1610.\n As the oldest city in the country, it offers a rich tapestry of historical architecture and remnants of the Merina kingdom, providing a unique glimpse into Madagascar’s regal past. \n For nature and wildlife enthusiasts, the Tsimbazaza Botanical and Zoological Garden, along with various private parks around the city offers a compact yet fascinating introduction to Madagascar’s unique fauna and flora. \n During the royal era, Antananarivo was primarily the domain of the Merina people. Today, however, it has grown into a vibrant, cosmopolitan city where all of Madagascar’s ethnic groups come together. This melting pot of cultures makes Antananarivo a dynamic hub of traditions, cuisine, and heritage. This diversity reflects the vision of King Andrianampoinimerina, who once declared, “Ny ranomasina no valam-parihako” “The ocean is the boundary of my kingdom.”\n A statement that feels prophetic today.\nBeyond the city itself, the surrounding regions offer a wonderful introduction to Madagascar as a whole. Nearby highlights include:\n• Andasibe National Park, home to the famous Indri lemur\n• Ampefy village, with its volcanic lakes and waterfalls\n• Ambohimanga, the sacred royal hill and UNESCO World Heritage Site\n• Ambatolampy, known for its traditional aluminum foundries\nSo, let’s embark on a journey to explore Antananarivo and its surrounding gems.\nAnd for a touch of nostalgia, don’t miss the opportunity to experience the city in style. On board a vintage 2CV, Volkswagen Beetle, or classic van. A truly timeless way to discover this enchanting capital!",

        "\nEast Coast Tour  \n \nA Tropical Exploration of Culture, Nature & History.\nLet’s begin with a fascinating anecdote!\nDuring Madagascar’s monarch era, King Radama I (1810–1828) set out to unify the island and introduce modern political structures. On his journey to the East Coast, he arrived at a vast body of water he had never seen before the Indian Ocean. Amazed, he dipped his finger into the water, tasted it, and exclaimed, “Toa Masina!” meaning “It’s salty!” in Malagasy. This moment gave birth to the name of the region’s main city: Toamasina.\nFrom Antananarivo, the heart of the Merina kingdom, to Toamasina, the capital of the Betsimisaraka tribe, this tropical route offers a breathtaking journey through lush rainforests and vibrant coastal life.\nAlong the way, you’ll pass through Andasibe-Mantadia National Park, \nhome to:\n• The largest lemur species in the world:Indri Indri, famous for its haunting calls,\n• The iconic Madagascar Boa,\n• A variety of endemic orchids and rare tropical plants.\nNext, discover Manambato, renowned for its twin lakes, Rasoabe and Rasoamasay,with the local legends. Nearby, explore the Palmarium Park, where lemurs roam freely, and native plant life thrives. It’s also home to charming accommodations that blend comfort with nature.\nThen, embark on a scenic journey along the Pangalanes Canal, a man-made waterway built during the French colonial period in the late 19th century to ease transport. This serene cruise offers a rare view of life between the Indian Ocean and peaceful Betsimisaraka fishing villages.\nFor food lovers, the East Coast is a true delight. Indulge in:\n• Fresh seafood caught daily,\n• The region’s signature dish: Zompina au Poivre Vert which is a flavorful local fish stew with green pepper.\nFinally, there’s the beautiful island of Sainte Marie, renowned for its spectacular humpback whale sightings during the month of September. It also boasts some of the East Coast’s most stunning beaches, second only to the famous Foulpointe beach.\nSo, pack your bags and join us for a tropical adventure full of history, biodiversity, and cultural discovery this is the East Coast of Madagascar!",
